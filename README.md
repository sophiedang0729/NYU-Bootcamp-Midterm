We are exploring how housing affordability and property characteristics vary across New York City properties. Our goal is to understand which areas are experiencing the fastest growth, how specific 
property features affect prices, and how proximity to amenities influences property values. Using publicly available datasets, our analysis compares property-level housing data to identify key patterns 
and trends in the NYC real estate market.
